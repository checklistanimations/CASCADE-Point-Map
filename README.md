**Point Map** is a PowerPoint add-in that introduces powerful tools for working with freeform shapes.  
With Point Map, you can move multiple points at once, nudge them precisely with the keyboard, and edit shapes in ways that PowerPoint has never supported out-of-the-box.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-point editing** – move several freeform points at once.  
- **Keyboard precision** – nudge points with arrow keys for exact placement.  
- **Adjust point size** – make points bigger or smaller for easier editing.  
- **Draw new freeforms** – create shapes while scrolling and panning the slide.  
- **Performance optimized** – avoids undo-history memory bloat.

## 🚀 Why Point Map?
PowerPoint’s built-in tools only allow point-by-point editing of freeform shapes. Point Map changes that by giving you precision, speed, and new creative possibilities.  

This tool is especially useful for:
- Designers creating complex illustrations.  
- Teachers and presenters who want exact shape control.  
- Anyone frustrated by PowerPoint’s limited point-editing tools.
