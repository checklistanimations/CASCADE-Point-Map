# Point-Map
A fairly ground breaking add-in that can be used to move points on PowerPoint freeform shapes. Multiple points can be moved at the same time and the points can be controlled by the keyboard. PowerPoint has never had this capability before. Uploaded for testing and promotion of other tools.
